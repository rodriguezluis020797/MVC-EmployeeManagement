Welcome to my sample Employee Management web application!
This is a model-view-controller (MVC) web application built using the .NET 8 framework.
With this app, you can manage employee details such as their name, hourly pay rate, and department. Please note that all data is static, as the application does not connect to a live database.
To keep things simple, the app simulates an already authenticated user experience.
